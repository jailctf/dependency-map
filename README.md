# cpython modules dependency map

work in progress

## what

ways to get from each python module to other python modules and by what means

## why

if we are in module A and we want to get module B on python version 3.X.X, we can get all of the paths and determine which one is ideal to use for a pyjail escape based on what is needed

## todo

- exclude multiline strings
- api? idk what this would entail
- easy script to run to get module dependencies for non-builtin module
